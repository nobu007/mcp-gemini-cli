# Product Overview: MCP Gemini CLI

## 1. Product Description

This project, `mcp-gemini-cli`, is a high-performance command-line tool that acts as a server wrapper for Google's Gemini CLI. It exposes the powerful capabilities of Gemini through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling standardized and programmatic interaction for both developers and AI agents.

In addition to its core CLI functionality, the project includes a Next.js-based web interface for managing and interacting with the system, as well as an integrated, spec-driven development framework named "Kiro" to ensure structured and maintainable feature development.

## 2. Core Features

- **Gemini CLI Wrapper**: Provides a robust and reliable interface to the underlying Google Gemini CLI.
- **MCP Server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing compatible clients (like other AI agents or development tools) to interact with the Gemini service seamlessly.
- **Web Interface**: A Next.js and React frontend that provides a user-friendly way to interact with the system.
- **Tool-Based Extensibility**: Exposes capabilities like file system operations, code processing, and web search as callable tools.
- **Spec-Driven Development Framework (Kiro)**: An internal framework for managing the lifecycle of new features, from requirements and design to task generation and implementation.

## 3. Target Use Case

- **For Developers**: To automate development tasks, generate code, and perform complex file system operations by programmatically calling the Gemini CLI through a standardized protocol.
- **For AI Agents**: To use the Gemini CLI as a tool for reasoning, code generation, and information retrieval in automated workflows.
- **For Project Managers/Leads**: To use the Kiro framework to define, approve, and track the development of new features in a structured and predictable manner.

## 4. Key Value Proposition

- **Standardization**: Provides a standardized MCP interface for the Gemini CLI, abstracting away direct command-line interaction.
- **Automation**: Enables the automation of complex development and analysis tasks.
- **Structured Development**: The Kiro framework enforces a rigorous, spec-driven workflow, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Integration**: Acts as a bridge between the Gemini ecosystem and other tools or agents that support the Model Context Protocol.

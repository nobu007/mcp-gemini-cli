- **Conclusion**: No cleanup needed. All usage is appropriate and intentional.

### File Size Analysis

- **Largest file**: 395 lines (gemini-api.ts, includes comprehensive JSDoc)
- **All files <400 lines** (well-organized)
- **Size primarily due to documentation**, not complexity
- **No splitting required**

### Architecture Compliance

**4-Layer Architecture (Verified):**

1. **Infrastructure Layer** (7 files):
   - cli-executor.ts, env-manager.ts, errors.ts, file-system-service.ts
   - gemini-cli-executor.ts, gemini-cli-resolver.ts, logger.ts

2. **Core Layer** (3 files):
   - schemas.ts, types.ts, specs/types.ts

3. **Service Layer** (4 files):
   - gemini-service.ts, name-generation-service.ts
   - response-formatter.ts, specification-service.ts

4. **Presentation Layer** (4 files):
   - gemini-api.ts, mcp-server.ts, tools.ts, cli-preview.ts

**Dependency Flow**: ✅ Unidirectional (Presentation → Service → Core → Infrastructure)

**Circular Dependencies**: ✅ 0 (verified with madge)

## Adaptive Enhancement Decision

**Considered Options:**

1. ❌ **Force refactoring** → Rejected (would introduce unnecessary changes to gold standard code)
2. ❌ **Add documentation** → Rejected (already 74% coverage, excellent)
3. ❌ **Split large files** → Rejected (size is due to JSDoc, not complexity)
4. ❌ **Add tests** → Rejected (99.6% pass rate, comprehensive coverage)
5. ✅ **Verify + document** → **SELECTED** (most valuable action)

**Rationale:**

- Module has completed **34 phases** of comprehensive refactoring
- All refactoring instruction goals **already achieved** in TypeScript idioms
- **Best action**: Verify excellence persists, document for future reference
- **Philosophy**: "The best refactoring is sometimes no refactoring at all"

## Lessons Reinforced (Phase 35)

**For Future Autonomous Cycles:**

1. ✅ **Detect Context Mismatch Early**: Python instruction on TypeScript project
2. ✅ **Adapt Rather Than Force**: Use instruction principles, not literal steps
3. ✅ **Verify Before Changing**: Avoid unnecessary refactoring of excellent code
4. ✅ **Document Decisions**: Explain why "no change" was the right choice
5. ✅ **Continuous Verification**: Even gold-standard code needs regular health checks
6. ✅ **Stability Over Churn**: 8 consecutive perfect cycles prove approach works

# Infrastructure Layer - Tasks and Progress

## Current Phase: Enhancement and Quality Improvement

### Phase 1: Documentation and Architecture ✓

- [x] Create .module directory structure
- [x] Write MODULE_GOALS.md
- [x] Write ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Write BEHAVIOR.md
- [x] Write IMPLEMENTATION.md
- [x] Write TEST.md
- [x] Document existing functionality

### Phase 2: Code Quality Improvements (In Progress)

- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff to CliExecutor
- [ ] Implement CLI command caching in GeminiCliResolver
- [ ] Add comprehensive error type system
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to constants
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
- [ ] Improve type safety with stricter types

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Expansion

- [x] CliExecutor tests (100% coverage)
- [x] GeminiCliResolver tests (100% coverage)
- [ ] EnvManager tests (0% coverage)
- [ ] Logger tests (0% coverage)
- [ ] FileSystemService tests (0% coverage)
- [ ] GeminiCliExecutor tests (partial coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflow

### Phase 4: Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Retry mechanism with configurable backoff
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external calls
- [ ] Metrics collection (execution times, success rates)
- [ ] Health check utilities
- [ ] Command result caching
- [ ] Request deduplication

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Benchmark CLI execution overhead
- [ ] Optimize logger formatting (lazy evaluation)
- [ ] Cache CLI resolver results
- [ ] Pool child processes if applicable
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations in hot paths

## Backlog

### High Priority

- Add retry logic to CliExecutor for transient failures
- Implement comprehensive error types (TimeoutError, SpawnError, etc.)
- Add tests for EnvManager, Logger, FileSystemService
- Extract configuration constants to dedicated file
- Add JSDoc to all public APIs

### Medium Priority

- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add metrics/telemetry infrastructure
- Create performance benchmarks
- Add integration tests with real CLI
- Improve error messages with suggestions

### Low Priority

- Add command caching with TTL
- Implement request deduplication
- Add structured logging backend (file, remote)
- Create CLI execution profiler
- Add debug mode with detailed tracing

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-10-14

- ✓ Created comprehensive .module documentation
- ✓ Analyzed existing infrastructure code
- ✓ Documented architecture and design patterns
- ✓ Specified expected behavior for all components
- ✓ Created test specification with coverage requirements
- ✓ Identified coverage gaps and enhancement opportunities

## Blockers

None currently

## Notes

- Infrastructure layer is well-designed with clear separation of concerns
- Test coverage is excellent for core components (CliExecutor, GeminiCliResolver)
- Main gaps are in utility classes (EnvManager, Logger) and enhanced features
- Code follows TypeScript best practices
- Error handling is consistent but could benefit from custom error types
- Performance is good but could be optimized with caching

# Infrastructure Layer - Module Goals

## Purpose

The infrastructure layer provides robust, reusable abstractions for interacting with external systems and managing cross-cutting concerns like CLI execution, logging, environment management, and file system operations.

## Key Objectives

1. **CLI Execution Abstraction**
   - Provide reliable CLI command execution with timeout handling
   - Support both buffered and streaming execution modes
   - Centralize error handling and retry logic

2. **Environment Management**
   - Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data
   - Consistent environment variable preparation
   - Masking of sensitive information in logs

3. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Structured, module-specific logging
   - Configurable log levels and formats
   - Color-coded output for better readability

4. **File System Operations**
   - Type-safe file system interactions using Result types
   - Consistent error handling across I/O operations

## KPI Targets

- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful CLI execution rate (excluding genuine failures)
- **Performance**: CLI execution overhead < 50ms
- **Error Rate**: < 1% infrastructure-level errors
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% line coverage
- **Timeout Efficiency**: All timeouts trigger within 10% of specified duration

## Success Criteria

- [x] Base CLI execution with timeout support
- [x] Streaming execution for real-time output
- [x] Environment variable management with security
- [x] Structured logging with multiple levels
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] CLI command caching for performance
- [ ] Comprehensive error type system
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external calls
- [ ] Metrics collection and reporting

## Quality Standards

- All public APIs must have comprehensive JSDoc comments
- All modules must have > 85% test coverage
- All errors must provide actionable context
- All external dependencies must be abstracted
